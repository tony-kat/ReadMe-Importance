# ReadMe-Importance
This Repository is about the importance of containing a ReadMe file.
In short, it is the best way to communicate your code to the world.
It is a great place to talk about the **basics** including but not limited to:
* What does this code do?
* How do I install it?
* Where do I get started?

When used correctly, ReadMe files can take projects containing *millions* of lines of code and explain them in a streamlined and easy-to-follow manner.

When used *creatively*, ReadMe files can be used even before the final product, serving as instructions and announcement boards for collaborators as well as to-do lists for organizing work.

*Ex.*
- [x] Turn on computer
- [ ] Update debugging software
- [x] Solve all Compile time errors
- [ ] Revisit Logic Error in line 56 of texture code file
- [ ] Finalize data aquisition method


To-Do lists like the example above are made possible by another neat trick offered by the ReadMe Feature, basic writing and formatting syntax. The text edit interface is pre-loaded with tons of formatting options that can be triggered via coded inputs in order to maximize your prose and connect thoughts/ideas/instructions as clearly as possible.

A very basic list of possible writing and formatting options are:

- **bold**
- *italic*
- ***bold italic combination***
- ~~strikethrough~~ 
- `code`
- Lists
  - Nested Lists
    - Twice
- [ ] Task⮧
- [x] Lists⮥
- @mentions
- :emoji::smile:

With mastery of these writing and syntax tricks, the possiblilites for ReadMe Files become ***endless***

One very important note: your repository can (and frankly should) include *multiple* ReadMe files for specific sections of the code in order to strongly reinforce clarity and transparency in your work. Often times a repository is far too complex for a general overweview and would function much better when its components are also explained.

I hope this File gave you a bit more insight as to what this repository is all about, as well as give an intro to the power of the ReadMe File.
