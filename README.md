# ReadMe-Importance
This Repository is about the importance of containing a readme file.
In short, it is the best way to communicate your code to the world.
It is a great place to talk about the **basics** including but not limited to:
* What does this code do?
* How do I install it?
* Where do I get started?
When used correctly, ReadMe files can take projects containing *millions* of lines of code and explain them in a streamlined and easy-to-follow manner.
When used creatively, ReadMe files can be used even before the final product, serving as instructions and announcement boards for collaborators as well as to-do lists for organizing work.
To-Do lists are made possible by another neat trick offered by the Read Me Feature, **Basic** *writing* and ~~gromnatting~~ formatting `syntax`
